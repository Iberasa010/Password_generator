# Password And PIN generator
A simple Python console application that creates passwords and PINs. Just a simple project I saw on Youtube, which was way simpler.
I added the customizable password and the PIN feature just to make it cooler ;)
Still needs to be documented. I have used the secrets() class instead of the random() class to make te generated passwords actually usable
and not dependant on algorithms that can easily be tracked.
The main purpose of this project was to do something in Python by myself. I have been reading a lot and I wanted to put some of that
in practice with a basic project, including the secrets class, and previously the random class.
I took the idea from https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp.
