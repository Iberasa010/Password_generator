# Password And PIN generator
A simple Python console application that creates passwords and PINs. Just a simple project I saw on Youtube, which was way simpler.
I added the customizable password and the PIN feature just to make it cooler ;)
Still needs to be documented and I want to make sure the passwords are secure by changing the random() function for the secret() Python function
so that the program is 100% usable.
The main purpose of this project was to do something in Python by myself. I have been reading a lot and I wanted to put some of that
in practice with a basic project.
I took the idea from https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp
