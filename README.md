# Password_generator
A simple Python console application that creates passwords and PINs. Just a simple project I saw on Youtube, which was way more simpler.
I added the customizable password and the PIN feature just to make it cooler ;)
Still needs to be documented and I want to make sure the passwords are secure by changing the random function for the secret() Python function
so that the program is 100% usable.
